Through a series of alternative cameras\u2014camera simulacra, camera ludica, and camera ocula\u2014told through a series of short films, the camera is reimagined not as a tool for image capture but as a medium for presence and attention. Each camera challenges a familiar photographic assumption: that a photograph is needed to capture a memory, that the camera must be reliable, or that photography can be a substitute for fleeting moments. In removing or subverting a camera\u2019s affordances, they ask what becomes of the photographic act when its conveniences are stripped away.",

Brochures are often too generic, leaving patients to Google, filter, and make sense of things alone. Yet even a scribbled doctor\u2019s memo \u2014 rough but personal \u2014 often becomes the most trusted reference. Voice2Choice builds on this insight, offering a digital system that captures the consultation as it happens \u2014 through live transcription, tailored visual aids, and patient-specific summaries. Patients leave not with fragments, but with a clear, personal record they can revisit, reflect on, and share \u2014 on their terms, and in their time.",

Rather than imposing form, the maker guides it by allowing the inherent behaviors of plaster, clay, water, and resistant materials to interact. The process embraces material computation, where form emerges from the material\u2019s own logic of absorption, flow, and resistance. Incorporating digital fabrication, pattern templates are designed and applied to guide how the clay responds during casting, while also storing steps that support the maker\u2019s process. By varying parameters within the resist slip casting process such as pattern placement and absorption timing, the clay responds by shaping itself. Each artefact becomes a record of both intention and material negotiation, echoing how nature formulates structure through interaction rather than control.",

By recognizing patterns, whether in human behavior, service touchpoints, or emerging technologies, Jerome connects the dots to build solutions that are rooted, resilient, and relevant.\n\nFor him, design is not purely about aesthetics, but about fitting solutions within the layered realities of people, processes, and environments. Specialising in service design and strategic thinking, he approaches challenges by zooming out, mapping relationships, spotting unseen connections, and shaping interventions that are as logical as they are elegant.\n\nMoving forward, Jerome aims to apply design as a form of strategic consulting, creating interventions that go beyond the surface toward lasting and meaningful impact.",

        "Personal Description": "\nHaziq doesn\u2019t design objects. He designs the quiet spaces between actions where hands meet objects, bodies meet space, and routines become rituals. With an ethnographer's patience and a poet's precision, he deciphers what others overlook: the hesitation before grasping, the lean into emptiness, the unspoken choreography of shared spaces. These become his raw material. His work whispers fluidity where others force, thoughtfulness where others compromise. No loud statements, just forms that adapt to real behavior. The best design, he believes, isn\u2019t seen but felt. It\u2019s the sudden realization that life could\u2019ve been this effortless all along.",

Whether creating a prototype by hand or coding an interactive interface, Dylan obsesses over the dialogue between physical and digital experiences. He believes the most memorable designs emerge when technology feels as warm and intentional as handcrafted objects. \n\nFor him, interaction design isn\u2019t just about functionality, it\u2019s about creating emotional resonance.

It helps trainees internalize the correct step-by-step feel of thoracostomy by offering key procedural cues such as needle aspiration feedback, a \u201cpop\u201d sensation upon pleural entry, and an LED system that signals organ punctures. This multisensorial feedback builds procedural confidence and prepares doctors to respond more effectively in high-pressure pneumothorax cases, where precision and speed are critical.",
