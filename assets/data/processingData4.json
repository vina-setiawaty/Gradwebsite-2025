        "Personal Description": "Jerome J. Wong grew up asking \"why\" and rarely stopped at the first answer. Curiosity was his starting point, but quickly became a habit of peeling back layers, searching for the roots behind ideas, objects, and systems.\n\nThis instinct to look beyond the obvious shaped his journey as a designer, evolving into a systems-based approach to problem-solving. By recognizing patterns, whether in human behavior, service touchpoints, or emerging technologies, Jerome connects the dots to build solutions that are rooted, resilient, and relevant.\n\nFor him, design is not purely about aesthetics, but about fitting solutions within the layered realities of people, processes, and environments. Specialising in service design and strategic thinking, he approaches challenges by zooming out, mapping relationships, spotting unseen connections, and shaping interventions that are as logical as they are elegant.\n\nMoving forward, Jerome aims to apply design as a form of strategic consulting, creating interventions that go beyond the surface toward lasting and meaningful impact.",
        "Icon Description": "A blooming tree, or explosion cloud, or inkblot from Rorschach.\nMy shape reflects the way I move through design: starting from curiosity, making sense of systems, and setting new possibilities into motion.\nWhat matters is not just the moment of change, but the patterns that rise from it when we step back and zoom out.",

In Singapore\u2019s high-pressure context, parents face rising guilt, stress, and isolation as structured support drops off during adolescence. This project reframes ADHD not just as a clinical condition but as a family experience, as studies have shown that parental wellbeing directly shapes teen outcomes.\n\nCo-created with over 80 parents, teens, clinicians, and ADHD organizations like IMH, Unlocking ADHD, SPARK and more, the guide focuses on everyday emotional flashpoints: school refusal, screen battles, late-night spirals and more. These 8 moments form the backbone of the book\u2019s structure, replacing unrelatable clinical chapters with situation-based flowcharts, emotional check-in tools, relatable storytelling, framing on why from the teens persepctive, and more.\n\n",

        "Personal Description": "He Kai is a designer who loves complexity, imaginary problems and new spaces. This currently intersects nicely with design about technology and interaction, where new toys emerge bi-daily, and he tries to reconcile this with his passion for crafts and making.\n\nFor He Kai, making is a game about spinning disparate elements into each other, forming spicy connections into conclusions that can withstand rigorous objective critique. Whether harmonious or dissonant, the goal is a cohesive use experience that approaches inevitability.\n\nHe enjoys shaping materials, experiences, and objects, anything with tight iteration cycles, often blurring all three; He hopes his designs feel natural.",
        "Icon Description": "The blending of 2 convex curves is rarely seen outside of nature, and conveys my core desire as a design student to retain the feeling of the human in my work, no matter how strange or abstract the outcomes. ",

        "Description_1": "Project Your Touch (PYT) is an exploration of alternative interactions for sculpting clay in VR, that leverages our familiarity with traditional craft methods found in analogue media to create a more intuitive, sensorial and expressive VR sculpting experience for newcomers. PYT reverses the relationship found in VR Haptic research, where typically physical contraptions align to virtual surfaces to create the illusion of contact. Instead, PYT uses tracked physical surfaces to project accurate geometry into the digital system in a manner that is surprisingly tactile and intuitive, at a fraction of the computation cost.",

        "Description_2": "This thesis presents 3 interactions that combine to form a functional 3d modelling program. Users hold out their hands to mold objects from nothing (addition), then 'sand' the mold down to a desired form using the sculptors' tool and proxy (subtraction), and finally detail their work (fine tooling). Instead of controlling parameters like brush intensity or size with sliders and menus, you simply slide your grip  along the handle, apply more or less pressure, or change the way you hold your brush. The system captures 5 more input dimensions that we find in our day to day tools.",
