JEROME JIMMY WONG,Jerome Wong,,Jerome.png,"Jerome J. Wong grew up asking ""why"" and rarely stopped at the first answer. Curiosity was his starting point, but quickly became a habit of peeling back layers, searching for the roots behind ideas, objects, and systems.

This instinct to look beyond the obvious shaped his journey as a designer, evolving into a systems-based approach to problem-solving. By recognizing patterns, whether in human behavior, service touchpoints, or emerging technologies, Jerome connects the dots to build solutions that are rooted, resilient, and relevant.

For him, design is not purely about aesthetics, but about fitting solutions within the layered realities of people, processes, and environments. Specialising in service design and strategic thinking, he approaches challenges by zooming out, mapping relationships, spotting unseen connections, and shaping interventions that are as logical as they are elegant.

Moving forward, Jerome aims to apply design as a form of strategic consulting, creating interventions that go beyond the surface toward lasting and meaningful impact.","A blooming tree, or explosion cloud, or inkblot from Rorschach.
My shape reflects the way I move through design: starting from curiosity, making sense of systems, and setting new possibilities into motion.

","ADHD interventions often focus on the diagnosed in this case the teens, the emotional load on parents is quietly overwhelming. In Singapore’s high-pressure context, parents face rising guilt, stress, and isolation as structured support drops off during adolescence. This project reframes ADHD not just as a clinical condition but as a family experience, as studies have shown that parental wellbeing directly shapes teen outcomes.

Co-created with over 80 parents, teens, clinicians, and ADHD organizations like IMH, Unlocking ADHD, SPARK and more, the guide focuses on everyday emotional flashpoints: school refusal, screen battles, late-night spirals and more. These 8 moments form the backbone of the book’s structure, replacing unrelatable clinical chapters with situation-based flowcharts, emotional check-in tools, relatable storytelling, framing on why from the teens persepctive, and more.
